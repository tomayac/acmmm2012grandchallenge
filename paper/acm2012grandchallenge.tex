\begin{abstract}
The chorus of the popular song \emph{Tik Tok} by the artist \emph{Ke\$ha} goes
\emph{``Don't stop, make it pop. DJ, blow my speakers up. Tonight, I'mma fight.
'Til we see the sunlight. Tik tok on the clock. But the party don't stop, no.''}
We all know, however, that each party comes to an end eventually.
With NiteOutMag\texttrademark, we present a~Web application
that can help people recover what (the hell) happened last night.
Among the younger generation, nightlife activities---just about like any other
activity---together with related multimedia data get shared online on social networks.
The problem is that for one and the same event, the event-related user-generated data
may be shared on a~plethora of social networks.
Therefore, for this challenge, we introduce an application
that leverages event data from several event databases,
social data from multiple social networks, and media data from some media platforms.
The collected data for events around a~given area is then compiled
in an event-centric magazine-like way, where each page represents one event.
Just like the nightlives of people happen \emph{ad hoc} from one party to the other,
the NiteOutMag\texttrademark~application as well
gathers all its data on-the-fly, without the burden of pre-compiled data directories.
The application is available online\footnote{\todo{Add demo link}}.
A~screencast showcasing the application is also available\footnote{\todo{Add screencast link}}.

\section{Introduction}
In March 2012, the at the time 901 million monthly active users
of the social networking site (SNS) Facebook
have uploaded more than 300 million photos on average per day~\cite{Facebook2012}.
Many of those photos are event-related, \emph{e.g.},
illustrate events like music concerts that a~social network user has attended.
Facebook, however, albeit the biggest, is only one among a~plethora of social networks
that event attendants may have shared their event-related content on.
In the next subsection, we thus list the SNSs considered for
NiteOutMag\texttrademark.

\subsection{Social Networks}
A~social network is an online service or media platform that focuses on building
and reflecting social relationships among people sharing interests and/or activities.
In this paper, we consider eleven different social networks
that represent all together most of the Western world's market share.
In detail, the considered social networks are
\mbox{Google+} (\url{google.com/+}),
Myspace (\url{myspace.com}),
Facebook (\url{facebook.com}),
Twitter ({twitter.com}),
Instagram (\url{instagram.com}),
Flickr (\url{flickr.com}),
YouTube (\url{youtube.com}),
yfrog (\url{yfrog.com}),
MobyPicture (\url{mobypicture.com}),
Twitpic (\url{twitpic.com}), and
\mbox{img.ly} (\url{img.ly}).

The actual detection of events based on information from SNSs
is out of bounds for this paper.
We point the reader to, \emph{e.g.},~\cite{Petkos2012} by Petkos \emph{et al.},
which is a typical example of event detection based on multimodal clustering.
For our purposes, event databases as listed below are adequate.
 
\subsection{Event Databases}
An event database is an online service that holds metadata
for a~categorized set of events that can be queried programmatically.
We consider four event databases, namely
Eventful (\url{eventful.com}),
Foursquare (\url{foursquare.com}),
Upcoming (\url{upcoming.org}), and
Google Places (\url{google.com/places}).

\section{Related Work}
Illustrating events with media items stemming from social networks
is an active topic of research since the rise of social networking.
In~\cite{Brenner2012}, Brenner and Izquierdo present
an approach to detect social events and retrieve associated photos
in collaboratively annotated photo collections combining data of various modalities
such as time, location, and textual and visual features.
In~\cite{Liu2011}, Liu \emph{et al.} present a method
combining semantic inferencing and visual analysis for automatically gathering
photos and videos illustrating events.

Regarding esthetic aspects of media compilation,
in~\cite{Sandhaus2011}, Sandhaus \emph{et al.} consider visual and
esthetic features for the automatic creation of photo books.
Obrador \emph{et al.}\ use visual and esthetic features
for a category-based approach to automatically assess
the esthetic appeal of photographs~\cite{Obrador2012}.


\section{Implementation}
In this section, we provide implementation details for the
NiteOutMag\texttrademark application.

\subsection{Geocoding}
The application focuses on events that occurred in a certain area.
While event databases tend to work based on concrete points like
\mbox{(40.7590110, -73.98447220)}, \emph{i.e.},
latitude and longitude pairs, human beings use more human-friendly place references
like ``Times Square, New York''.
Geocoding is the process of finding associated geographic coordinates
(often expressed as latitude and longitude) from other geographic data,
such as street addresses, or zip codes.
The user can enter an exact address, such as
``618 W. 46th St, New York, NY 10036'', or a very broad area like ``Las Vegas''.
The returned latitude and longitude pair is always the center
of the particular point or area of interest.
In our implementation, we use the Google Geocoding API~\cite{Geocoding2012}.

\subsection{Event Search}
Based on a latitude and longitude pair, we search the before-mentioned
event databases via their respective event search
APIs~\cite{Eventful2012,Foursquare2012,GooglePlaces2012,Upcoming2012}
for \emph{past} events within an empirically determined radius of five kilometers.
We sanitize the event titles by removing HTML tags, punctuation,
common abbreviations (like ``w/'', which becomes ``with'', or ``ft./feat.'',
which become ``featuring'').
As all events are geographically close, we deduplicate the returned set of events
based on the simple, yet effective Levenshtein distance
with an empirically determined editing distance of five,
which catches things like ``Titanic'' and ``Titanic 3D'' for, \emph{e.g.}, movie events.

\subsection{Media Search}
Unlike event search, media search in our application is not based on geolocation.
This is due to the fact that only a small number of microposts with media items
are properly geotagged.
In a~study performed in May 2012, Seline showed that only roughly 1\% of all microposts
on Twitter carry geographical data~\cite{Quora2012}.
In addition to that, as our approach covers more than just Twitter,
not all SNSs support geotagging ones content.
